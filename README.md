**Basic Inspection Lot Creation & Processing – SAP QM**

This project demonstrates the complete end‑to‑end process of Inspection Lot Creation and Processing in SAP Quality Management (QM). It covers master data setup, procurement integration, inspection execution, results recording, and usage decision — forming the foundation of any QM implementation.


1. Project Overview

        This repository provides a practical, step‑by‑step demonstration of how an organization performs incoming inspection (Inspection Type 01) for procured materials. It includes:

                Master data preparation
                Purchase order creation
                Goods receipt triggering inspection lot
                Inspection lot processing
                Results recording
                Usage decision and stock posting

        This scenario is widely used in manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, automotive, FMCG, and other industries where material quality is critical.


2. Business Scenario
   
        A company procures raw materials from a vendor. Upon receiving the material, the system must:
        
                Automatically create an Inspection Lot
                Allow the Quality team to perform results recording
                Enable the Quality Manager to take a Usage Decision (UD)
                Post the material to Unrestricted, Blocked, or Scrap based on quality results
                This ensures that only quality‑approved materials enter the production process.


3. Process Flow Diagram

        Provides the end‑to‑end process flow diagram explaining how the inspection lot is created and processed during the procurement cycle.

        
4. T‑Codes Used in This Project

        Lists all SAP transaction codes relevant to inspection lot creation, results recording, and usage decision.


5. Key Learnings

        How SAP QM integrates with MM during procurement
        How inspection lots are automatically created during GR
        How to perform results recording for quantitative & qualitative MICs
        How to take a usage decision and post stock accordingly
